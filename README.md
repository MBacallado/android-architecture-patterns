# Android Architecture Patterns – Kotlin (2019)

This repository contains the complete source code for an educational project on **Android Architecture Patterns**, used as part of a public talk on software architecture at TLP Innova 2019.

It is designed as a **practical comparison** of real implementations of the same Android app using different architecture patterns.

---

## 🧠 Topics covered

This project demonstrates the following architecture patterns in real Android apps built with Kotlin:

✅ Spaghetti Code – no architecture, just raw code.  
✅ MVP – Model View Presenter.  
✅ MVVM – Model View ViewModel.  
✅ VIPER – View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router.

Each architecture is available in a separate branch.  
You can explore how each one affects **separation of concerns**, **testability**, and **code maintenance**.

## 🗂️ Branch structure

| Branch           | Architecture | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `master`         | Spaghetti    | No architecture, tightly coupled code. |
| `mvp_pattern`    | MVP          | Presenter handles logic, View is passive. |
| `mvvm_pattern`   | MVVM         | ViewModel exposes observable data to View. |
| `viper_pattern`  | VIPER        | Clean and scalable, inspired by iOS VIPER. |
