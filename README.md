Example code explaining the following patterns:

- Spaghetti code? -> Branch: master
- MVP (Model - View - Presenter) -> Branch: mvp_pattern
- MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) -> Branch: mvvm_pattern
- Viper (View - Interactor - Presenter - Entity - Router) -> Branch: viper_pattern

For a better understanding of these patterns, you can look at this presentation on this topic
